<h2>🏞️ Laketown</h2>
<p><em>A city by the waters of Lake Nio, created by newcomers for newcomers.</em></p>

<p>🧭 Start your adventure</p>

<p>A young town where you can play through every stage of the game on your own. A great start for those who want to learn Vintage Story from scratch.</p>

<p>🤝 Barter economy</p>

<p>Laketown’s only rule is internal trade by barter. Simple and fair exchange of goods between players.</p>

<p>🧙‍♂️ RP immersion</p>

<p>We love roleplay and offer a set of unique professions with privileges, tasks, and the feel of true medieval life.</p>

<p>🏰 Freedom and self-governance</p>

<p>Want to live separately yet remain part of the city? Become a landlord—establish an estate near Laketown and run your own homestead.</p>

<strong>Laketown is a chance to build your own story.</strong>
A game with atmosphere, soul, and a real community.
