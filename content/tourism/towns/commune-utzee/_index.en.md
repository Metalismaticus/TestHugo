<h2>🏯 Commune Utzee</h2>
<p><em>A newly-formed free community on the outskirts of Mylesville.</em></p>

---

<p>🗽 Freedom and voluntary participation</p>

<p>The commune is built on freedom, voluntarism, and the absence of coercion.  
No taxes, no bans, no bureaucracy.  
The only rule — respect nature and avoid excessive deforestation.</p>

<p>⚖️ Self-governance</p>

<p>The Consul does not command or impose restrictions.  
All support and decisions are voluntary. Each resident acts freely and responsibly.</p>

<p>🎍 Creative style</p>

<p>Organic architecture and natural paths.  
Most buildings feature a Japanese-inspired style, forming a calm and atmospheric settlement.</p>

---

<p>📍 Location</p>

<p>~2 minutes on foot from Mylesville and its teleport to Bronze City.  
Direct teleport to Emerald Port is also available.</p>

<p>👥 Community</p>

<p>Friendly and active players. Full offline happens rarely — the commune lives and grows.</p>
